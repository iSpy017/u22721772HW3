# jsreport.Types

This package includes strong types like `Configuration` or `RenderRequest` which are shared across the .net sdk for jsreport repositories. The releases of the package should match the type changes in jsreport itself. So if you use older jsreport, you should still be able to use the latest sdk just with matching release of `jsreport-dotnet-types`.

You can find examples and documentation in the [jsreport sdk for .net home page](https://jsreport.net/learn/dotnet).
The general development and contribution instructions can be find in the [jsreport for .net  root repository](https://github.com/jsreport/jsreport-dotnet).
